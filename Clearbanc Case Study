A fast, affordable way for founders to fund their business.


### Company Information[^1]

**Company Name:**  Clearbanc

**Year Incorporated:**  2015

**Founders:  **Michele Romanow of CBC’s “Dragons’ Den”, Andrew D’Souza, Ivan Gritsiniak, Charlie Feng, and Tanay Delima

**Headquarters: **Toronto, Canada.

**Source of Funding:  **Venture Capital partners, including:  Highland Capital, Emergence, Founder’s Fund, and Inovia

**Funding to Date:** $420 million CAD

**How did the idea for the company come about?**

_“I built the product that I wanted to have as an ecommerce entrepreneur,” Clearbanc co-founder Michele Romanow_[^2]_._

Clearbanc’s “serial entrepreneur” co-founders originally launched the company to help streamline finances for entrepreneurs and the self-employed, like themselves. The first application was a service that allowed Uber drivers to be paid instantly using a Visa debit card using faster credit card interchange networks, rather than waiting 10 days to be paid the traditional way through bank rails and ACH.

In 2015 co-founder Andrew D’Souza was accepted to participate in a cohort of Y Combinator, the legendary startup incubator that launched Stripe, Airbnb, DoorDash, Coinbase, and Instacart. Shortly after, D’Souza returned home to Canada, now joined by “Serial Entrepreneur” Michelle Romanow[^3].  Responding to market demand for capital, Clearbanc announced a pivot to focus on small business lending in 2018, powered by AI and machine learning to assess the financial prospects of a potential borrower.[^4]

_“We want Clearbanc to be the front-door to your financial life if you’re self-employed.”_[^5]_- Clearbanc co-founder, Andrew D’Souza_


## Business Activities {#business-activities}


### Financial problem being solved {#financial-problem-being-solved}

Small business owners need capital to get their business up and running. These entrepreneurs often face time consuming and costly challenges securing the necessary startup funds[^6]. Developing the perfect pitch, a solid business plan, and pitching and convincing VC firms and banks take up much of a founder’s time and attention and requires costly expertise from lawyers and financial advisors. Additionally, lending can be biased to the disadvantage of women and minority entrepreneurs.  Once funds are secured, they cost more in interest, fees and, often, a hefty share in company ownership. The outcome of this problem is that many small businesses fail, or fail to receive funding.

Clearbanc simplifies the process and shortens the time to funding to as little as 20 minutes. They have developed “the 20-minute term sheet” that uses mass amounts of data and machine learning to provide insights into business deals and the future value of a business. This foresight allows them to predict future cash flows, and confidently underwrite these businesses for a secured loan in less than 24 hours.[^7]

Small businesses and entrepreneurs that start successful businesses create jobs and contribute to job growth and social innovations. By providing entrepreneurs greater access to capital, Clearbanc is removing barriers to prosperity for hard-working small business owners and their communities.[^8]


### Market and Market Size {#market-and-market-size}

**Market:** Entrepreneurs, small business, freelance professionals, self-employed creatives

**Market domains:** Software, consumer goods

**Market focus, target persona**: e-commerce startups with revenue that don't want to sell equity and need capital to pay for inventory, or marketing to acquire customers

**Market geography: **US and Canada

**Market Volume and Value:** 

Total Market Volume of Securities, loans and investments traded in the US from Quarter 3, 2019 to the end of Quarter 2, 2020[^9] = **2.74 trillion USD = 3.51 trillion CAD**

Estimated Market Volume of Securities, loans and investments traded in Canada in 2018:  **1.2 trillion CAD**

**Market Penetration of SMBs:** 50% of total market, growing at 4% annually[^10]

**Estimated market value of small business loans and securities in US and Canada:** 

**2.45 Trillion CAD annual and growing**


### Unique Market Advantage {#unique-market-advantage}

Clearbanc funds small businesses through a unique revenue share agreement.[^11] Revenue provides an alternative for entrepreneurs looking for growth without giving up equity or putting up their home as collateral. Banks account for the majority of lending, and tend to overlook or disregard the riskier die of the market. The excessive prudence of banks is Clearbanc’s opportunity to take the market lead in this underserved sector.

Their approach combines real business data to predict future sales, and business metrics, and market data from technology partners like Stripe and other Clearbanc customers.  The offers are based purely on data, and less biased. They are accessible online, so no travel required. Clearbanc can produce a term sheet in less than a week for more complex deals or as few as 20 minutes for more straightforward cash advances.
